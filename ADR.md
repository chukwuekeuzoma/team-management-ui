# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document contains the key architectural decisions made for the Team Management System.

## ADR-001: State Management with Zustand over React Context

**Decision**: Use Zustand for state management instead of React Context API.

**Rationale**: Zustand was chosen over React Context for its simplicity, performance, and developer experience. Unlike Context API which can cause unnecessary re-renders and requires complex provider patterns, Zustand provides a lightweight store with automatic subscription management and no boilerplate. The team management system requires frequent state updates (CRUD operations, filtering, pagination) where Zustand's optimized re-render behavior and TypeScript integration significantly improve maintainability and performance.

## ADR-002: Client-Side Pagination over Server-Side Pagination

**Decision**: Implement client-side pagination instead of server-side pagination for the team management interface.

**Rationale**: Client-side pagination was chosen because the team dataset is relatively small and static, making it more efficient to load all data once and handle pagination in the browser. This approach reduces server requests, provides instant filtering and sorting capabilities, and offers better user experience with immediate responsiveness. The trade-off of slightly larger initial load time is acceptable given the dataset size and the significant UX benefits of client-side operations.

## ADR-003: Component Composition over Monolithic Components

**Decision**: Break down the main Table component into smaller, composable utility functions and sub-components.

**Rationale**: The original monolithic Table component was refactored into smaller, focused utilities (pagination, filtering, sorting, modal handlers) to improve maintainability, testability, and reusability. This composition pattern allows for easier debugging, better separation of concerns, and enables individual testing of business logic without UI dependencies. The extracted utilities can be reused across different components and make the codebase more scalable.
